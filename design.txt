NOTES ON THE CONVENTIONS AND FORMATTING USED IN THIS CODE PROJECT
-source files are named with capital letters to distinguish them from python modules

-other files are named in lowercase and named as .POPY files, which are just stored as ASCII plaintext

-tabs	are	used	for	indentation,	not	spaces

-the standard maximum line-width is 80 characters for this code, with few exceptions

-functions should not exceed 40 lines in length, including line breaks

-functions typically use camelCase for naming, see 3 exceptions below

-Action functions are named with single capitalized words. Action functions are functions in Parser.py that are called as a result of player actions, or methods which are called by a corresponding Parser.py action function. For instance, the Look() function, which may call a Look() method on an item. This is to distinguish these functions from certain python keywords and built-ins

-functions with names that are multiple abbreviated words are purely lowercase

-the Creature methods which return the ability score for a creature are denoted purely in capital letters, such as MXHP(), and ATCK()

-classes are named with capital letters

-typically, instances of objects are either denoted with capital letters, or with words. For example, an instance of the Item() class may either be I, item, or some other word depending on the use case.

-the global objects P, W, and G refer to the Player, World, and Game objects

-typically, capital S refers to a "source" item. That is, an item which contains another item, usually I.

-strings are denoted with "", unless it is necessary to use a string that contains " in it, in which case, the entire function of relevance uses '' to denote strings

-strings which are concatenated with variables are formatted using f-string formatting, however the + operator is used when there are only two terms to concatenate. For example;
	f"There is no '{obj.name}' here"
	f"There is {listItems()} in this room"
	"You take the " + item.name
	"There is " + gprint("a",obj.anem,3,1)



GAMEPLAY MECHANIC GOALS:

-lore/easter eggs are conveyed to the player in engaging but mysterious ways
-players can get a well-formatted display and description of their stats
-enemies and player have a perception system
-save ability and checkpoints, where respawn occurs if players die
-npcs have dynamic communication options which interact with RP
-combat can happen in a dynamic way, which may not always end in a death
-tinkering can be done to create and adapt items magically
-global events can occur which persistently alter something about the world
-rooms are persistent globally
-spells can occur and affect the game in many unique ways
-fun cheat codes?



CORE CODE DESIGN:

some file contains base framework;
	player class, room class, item class
okay so some file contains all room objects in the world
another file contains all creatures objects in the world
another file contains all item objects in the world
main will probably contain the parser, player object and all action functions

a txt file contains the save, which includes:
	all player stats
	current room
	all rooms in the world and their contents/settings? <- hard part
	certain global event variables

in main
there are two major objects
	player
	game (containing currentroom, prevroom, and time)

player contains all player attributes and methods
currentroom contains a room object of the room the player is currently in
prevroom represents the last room object that was currentroom
time represents the number of player actions taken since the game's beginning



FRAMEWORK OF THE GAME
every room contains a set of string room names denoting its connected rooms
main() runs a parsing loop, that loops taking valid input
	when parser encounters a valid command, it runs, calls an action function, which may do various things.

	The move() action will check for valid commands, and triage which room to move to, if any possible given the command. This will take the correct room object stored in currentroom's set of room connections, initialize the new room, set previous room to current room and set current room equal to new room, then call current room's "enter" function, which will print the initial room description and take care of some initial things

	Most other valid actions either alter some feature of the room object, some item in the room, something about the player object, or do some of each.

	Additionally, certain commands do external things, like save the game, cancel last action, or print useful info for the player





HOW PARSING INPUT WORKS (EXAMPLE)
"""
What will you do?
> I will attack the Green Snake, with my Iron Sword.
"""

In the above example, the user provides the raw input:
	"I will attack the Green Snake, with my Iron Sword."

- input processing in processCmd():

First, the raw input is turned to lowercase:
	"i will attack the green snake, with my iron sword."
Then, the input is purified by removing extraneous symbols:
	"i will attack the green snake with my iron sword"
Then, the input is split by spaces into a list of words:
	["i","will","attack","the","green","snake","with","my","iron","sword"]
Next, articles and determiners (and other extraneous words) are removed:
	["attack","green","snake","with","iron","sword"]
The nounify() step combines words which appear to be a single meaningful term:
	["attack","green snake","with","iron sword"]

- parsing input in parse():

the verb is assumed to be the first word of the processed command:
	verb = "attack"
If the command is multiple words, the preposition is found (if it exists) by comparing each word to a set of known prepositions. In this case:
	prep = "with"
if there are more words, the direct object is assumed to be the first word after the verb that is not a preposition. In this case:
	dobj = "green snake"
if there are still more words, the indirect object is the first word after the preposition or direct object. In this case:
	iobj = "iron sword"

So parse() assigns terms to verb, dobj, iobj, and prep. The nature of this input parser is such that it cannot accurately parse input with more than these four important terms. It cannot properly interpret arbitrarily complex input.



ROOM:

room has several attributes:
name - every room must have a unique name
description
size?
allexits: set of adjacent rooms (n, ne, e, se, s, sw, w, nw, u, d, b)
exits: set of directions denoting accessible adjacent rooms
allcontents: set of all items and creatures in the room
contents: set of booleans denoting which items and creatures are 'hidden' or not
additional room booleans and characteristics

#note: each object should contain a list of objects it is adjacent to in the room. Any objects adjacent to eachother must share all adjacent objects
#currently in question: should room store a 2d array of items which are passable/impassable.
#alternative answer: objects all participate in an adjacency matrix as discussed above, but they include a distance factor ranging from (adjacent, near, far, distant, on top of, under, within?) and room include a size factor (small, medium, large, vast)

#idea about movement (in or out of combat): movement determines how many steps it takes you to change from adj,near,far,distant or any of those in between. And in that "time" span it takes you to move, other creatures can do things.
#ex. you move from adj to far, which is a constant distance of 50, your movement is 30, so it takes you two steps to move, meanwhile the goblin could attack twice.

room methods:
init
repr
describe exits
describe contents
describe #gonna be elaborate


NOTES WHEN MAKING A ROOM:
- every room must have a unique name which is NOT also a term in any of the game's data sets (except the World dict, which consists entirely of Room names)
- by convention and necessity, room names must be lowercase (since user input is always lowercase and string comparisons are frequently done with room names)
- every room exit must refer to the name of an existing room (otherwise runtime errors will occur)
-pay attention to room exits. Generally, a connection between any two rooms should be two-way. That is, if "glen" has a northern exit to "big tree", "big tree" should have a southern exit to "glen". Exceptions to this recommendation are allowed but should only be used when there's good in-game reason to do so
-every item in the room must be of an existing item class
-every creature in the room must of an existing creature class




ITEM:
An item is any object in the game which can be interacted with which is not a room and which is not a creature. Specifically, an item can exist within a room's contents, within another item's contents, or within a Creature's inventory (including Player's inventory)

The simplest item has attributes; name, description, weight, and durability.
Items of class Weapon() come with a number of additional attributes regarding their statistics as a utility in combat.
Items of class Box() come with a boolean "open" attribute and a list of "contents" of Items they contain.
Items of class Sign() contain a "text" attribute"
Items of class Switch() contain an "effect" attribute, which is a string which is used with the global "effects" dict, mapping these strings to Effect functions. Effect functions affect the World in some way.

NOTES WHEN MAKING AN ITEM:
- Items do not necessarily have to have unique name, but there are parsing limitations when multiple items have the same name. Only give two items the same name if they are identical or negligibly distinct to a user.
- Items names should NOT be a term which also exists in any of the game's data sets (except the Items dict, which consists entirely of Item names). There are cases where code will be unable to reliably parse the ambiguity between an item name and some other important term, like the direction "up", or the word "toward", for instance.
- When adding an item, make sure its class exists in the Objects.py Items dict
- The order of attributes matters! when writing the attributes into the World data file, the attributes must be in the correct order as defined in the __init__ method of the class



PLAYER:

NAME - player-defined name

RACE - what character race you are, each race gets a stat bonus to two stats

DESCRIPTION - player-defined character description

BASE - defined as a dict of 10 pairs

DERIVED - defined as a dict of 24 pairs

LV - level (int)
player level, initially 1, ranges 1-20

XP - experience (int)
player experience points, initially 0, ranges.. to 100,000??

RP - reputation points (int)
reputation you've built for yourself, initially 0, ranges -100 to 100. Having a higher charisma improves your potential to alter your RP

HP - current hit points (int)
initially max, ranges 0 to MXHP

MP - current mana points (int)
initially max, ranges 0 to MXHP

MONEY - defined as a list [cp, sp, gp, pp]
			represented	by	%	&	$	@

GEAR - a dict of many pairs, each one representing a slot in which an item can be equipped. Included player's hands, clothing, and additional items.

STATUS - a set of all status effects currently affecting the player



LEVELING:

XP - experience points
amount of experience player has amassed
gained by fighting, killing, socializing, praying, etc.

LV - level
player level, ranging 1 - 20
determined by XP
LV = min1(floor(  5*log10(x/10)  ))

QP - quality points
amount of experience player has with different attributes called qualities.
determined by level and race
the lowest any stat can begin at is 1
different races get an initial bonuses to any qualities totaling +10

Total quality points should be 7 + 3*LV,
i.e., the player has 1 in all ten qualities at level 1, and gains 3 points total with each level up
upon leveling up the player allocates the 3 new points to the categories of their choice, in any amount they would like

SWITCHES, LEVERS, BUTTONS:

A switch is a superclass which contains levers and buttons
Switches can be interacted with (via "use","pull","switch","press",etc.)
When a switch is "triggered", it calls a specific effect which affects something about the world. In data, switches are stored with a string which refers to a function stored in the effects dict (at the bottom of Objects.py)
This function is called when a switch is "triggered"

Levers are switches that have 2 states; on or off. They change something when switched "on", and have the reverse effect when switched "off"

Buttons are switches that simply do something when they are triggered. There can be permanent buttons, which can only be triggered once, or recurring buttons which can be triggered multiple times.

Traps are switches that are triggered when the player performs an action other than "pull","switch", or "press". In other words, a switch which is triggered unintentionally by the player. Typically, a trap can only be triggered once, i.e. it has an attribute which begins as "off" and can only be changed to "on"


WHAT CAN SWITCHES DO? (EXAMPLES)

They can change the gamemode
They can make an item or creature appear in the room
Can alter something about an item, creature, or fixture in the room
They can reveal a door to another room
They can alter a players stats or status
They can alter something in a different room in the world



A GENERIC ACTION FUNCTION:

if prepositions are invalid, return false
if dobj or iobj values are required but not provided, ask for them
search for required iobj and dobj objects in room or on player:
	if they do not exist, return false
if required iobj and dobj do not have the necessary attributes, return
if the item object is affected in some way, call the relevant item methods
if the player object is affected in some way, call relevant player methods
return True


TYPES OF ACTION FUNCTIONS:

-no-prep function: functions which cannot take a preposition value:
-single-prep functions: functions which take a single prepositon, usually "with"
-multi-prep functions: functions which take a number of possible prep values

-inventory search function: functions which search the player inv for an item
-room item search function: functions which search room contents for an item
-room creature search function: search room occupants for a creature
-room search functions: search room for an item or creature
-item search function: search room and player inv for an item
-object search function: search room and player inv for creature or item

IDEAS FOR CREATURES/NPCS:

generally, three categories of creatures,
person, monster, animal
"villain" - subclass; big bad version of person
"boss" - subclass; big bad version of a monster
"beast" - subclass; big bad version of an animal

all creatures have two stats associated with behavior toward the player:

fondness: -100 to 100, represents how much they like the player, a creature with high fondness for the player is less likely to act aggressively toward the player, and more likely to be persuaded or deceived by the player

fear: -100 to 100, represents how much they fear the player, a creature with high fear of the player is less likely to act aggressively toward the player, and less likely to be deceived by the player, but more likely to be persuaded

people have dialogue options for the player and can be communicated with, persuaded, or deceived.

monsters and animals cannot communicate with the player. Animals typically act more passively than monsters and have a limited set of actions they can take. Monsters can use items and weapons.

each person has an initial value for their fondness and fear of new strangers (meaning the player), but upon meeting the player each time, their values deviate from that initial value with a firstImpression() function, which takes in several factors, including the player's amount gear, their type of gear, and their reputation points and sets their fondness and fear values. fear and fondness change with very subsequent meeting with the player to a lesser degree based on the same factors.

fondness and fear are changed by specific dialogue options pursued by the player, and specific actions taken by the player taken toward the creature. additionally, dialogue options the player has with a given person are dependent upon how fond or fearful the person is.

These values can also change, for monsters and animals as well, based on certain actions like giving gifts, buying and selling merchandise, attacking, healing, or casting a spell

//note: creatures should contain a value which indicates how it will be addressed e.g. "The goblin", "Goblin", "a goblin", "goblins"


MAKING AN ATTACK:

turn order is determined by ATSP:
    order is highest to lowest attack speed,
    ties are settled by the highest SPD
    ties of SPD are settled by 'defender goes first'
number of attacks is determined:
    n = floor(ATSP / target.ATSP) //maybe
for each attack:
    chance to hit is determined:
        if weapon.ranged
            HIT = min1(max99(ACCU - target.EVSN)) - min0(dist(player, target) - weapon.range)
        else
            HIT = min1(max99(ACCU - target.EVSN))
		percentage roll to HIT
    chance to crit is rolled
    attack is rolled:
		attack = STR d weapon.might
		if critical
			attack *= 3
    damage is calculated:
		damage = min0(attack - target.DFNS)
    damage is dealt:
        enemy.hp -= damage
		#called in the enemy object, dmgtype passed as well

EQUIPPING ITEMS/WEAPONS:

ASSIGNING WEAPONS AND SHIELDS

CASTING A SPELL:

really just depends...

fruits - minimally increase hp, each fruit adds a different status effect
veggies - minimally increase hp, minimally increases mp, can remove bad status effects
dairy - minimally increase hp and mp, can remove bad status effects
alcohol - same effects as fruit, but adds drunkeness

WORLD DESIGN IDEAS:

several different "dungeons" exist in the the world
however, I dont want them to be super "temple-y" like Legend of Zelda. that feels too restrictive, i want the world to feel less linear/sequential and a bit more open-ended

so these dungeons are generally just clusters of room nodes in the world graph that match a certain theme or aesthetic, and they have different general difficulty levels

-regular forest (starting location)
-the gallery
-mobile massive wizard school (with portal entrances around the world)
-a buried giant (inside of which is a dungeon? rooms like "giant foot")
-haunted manor, abandoned manor on a hill thats v spooky
-ancient mystical forest, full of illusions thats difficult to navigate
-the catacombs, simple basic religious dungeon under a giant old cathedral
-atlantis, underwater castle thats coral reef themed and fun, entered by getting to an island somewhere
-caverns, early dungeon that is large underground caverns
-necropolis, a massive sandy persian themed graveyard
