# Potions and Pythons
*version Alpha*
*by Ross Carter Peene*
*2022*

To play the game, you can run the executable file in the main directory containing the World.json file.

To compile the executable yourself from the source code, you must have Python and Pip installed.
Python and Pip can be installed from python.org/downloads/
You must install pyinstaller using the command "pip install pyinstaller" in your terminal.
Then you can run make.bat (for Windows) or make.sh (for Linux/Mac) in the main directory

Additionally, if you have Python installed, you may play the game without compiling to an executable by running PoPy.py directly with Python.
PoPy.py should be in the /src directory and the /src directory should be in the same directory as the World.json file.
