### Play from executable
To compile the executable yourself from the source code, you must have Python and Pip installed. Python and Pip can be installed [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
You must install pyinstaller using the following command in your terminal.  

```command pip install pyinstaller```

Then you can run `make.bat` (for Windows) or `make.sh` (for Linux/Mac) in the main directory. The source code will be compiled into an executable called `PoPy` which can be run and played!

### Play from source code
To play without compiling an executable, you must have Python installed. Python can be installed [here]([python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)). You can run `src/PoPy.py` with Python and play!
