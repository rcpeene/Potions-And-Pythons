### Play from executable
To compile the executable yourself from the source code, you must have Python and Pip installed. Python and Pip can be installed from [python.org/downloads]().
You must install pyinstaller using the command "pip install pyinstaller" in your terminal. Then you can run `make.bat` (for Windows) or `make.sh` (for Linux/Mac) in the main directory. The source code will be compiled into an executable called `PoPy` which can be run and played!

### Play from source code
To play without compiling an executable, you must have Python installed. Python can be installed from [python.org/downloads](). You can run `src/PoPy.py` with Python and play!
