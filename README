Potions and Pythons
version Alpha
by Ross Carter Peene
2022

To play the game, you can run the executable file in the same directory as the World.json file.

To compile the executable yourself from the source code, you must have Python and Pip installed.
Python and Pip can be installed from python.org/downloads/
You must install pyinstaller using the command "pip install pyinstaller" in your terminal.
Then you can run make.bat (for Windows) or make.sh (for Linux/Mac) in the same directory as the /src/ directory.

Additionally, if you have Python installed you may play the game without compiling to an executable by running PoPy.py in the /src/ directory as long as /src/ is in the same directory as the World.json file.
